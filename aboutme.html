        <p> Animals</p>
        <p>As a child, I didn't have the opportunity to keep a pet at home,
          but that's why whenever I saw a kitten or a dog on the street, I went and petted them.
          I have only kept small fish at home, but unfortunately they died, because they don't live long.
          I also really like to ride horses, but I don't do it professionally, only sometimes as a hobby.
          I can say that animals are an important part of my life, as much as music is.</p>

        <p>Music</p>
        <p>I love to listen to slow music, but sometimes also pop.
          The genre of the song changes depending on how I feel at that moment.
          Most of the time I listen to Turkish and English songs and less in any other language.
          Sometimes I post a song on my social media that really describes my emotions at that moment.

        <p>Sport</p>
        <p>If we talk about sports, I have a lot of experience.
          When I was in elementary school, I coached handball for 5 years.
          Then, at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school, I coached volleyball for three years.
          A few months ago I also went to kangoo jumping, but I quit because of university.
          Sports have always been a part of recreation and hobby and I want to be active in such things as long as I can.</p>

        <p>Relax time</p>
        <p>When I want to relax, besides listening to music, I also read books.
          Books lead me to different imaginations and I feel like I'm in a different world.
          Also the sea, one of the top things that relaxes me infinitely.
          If I could, I would spend my whole life on an island.</p>
